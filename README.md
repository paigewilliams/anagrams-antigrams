## Description

This is an exercise in creating custom classes and methods in Ruby. The goal is to write an algorithm that follows the following rules.

  1. Check if two words are anagrams.
  2. Account for the possibility that words may have different cases, but should still be anagrams.
  3. Check if input is an actual word. In this exercise words must contain a vowel.
  4. If phrases are not anagrams, the method should check if they are antigrams. An antigram is a word that does not contain any of the letters another word contains.
  5. Account for multiple words being anagrams or antigrams.
